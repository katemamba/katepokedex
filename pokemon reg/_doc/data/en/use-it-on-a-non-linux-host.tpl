<p>Of course, you can do it with <strong>pH7CMS</strong>!</p>
<p>All versions are compatible with Mac OS and from <em>1.0.2</em> version for Windows OS.</p>
<p>You can install a server manually but to simplify tasks, we generally recommend <a href="http://www.mamp.info" target="_blank"><strong>MAMP</strong></a> for Mac and <a href="http://www.wampserver.com" target="_blank"><strong>WampServer</strong></a> for Windows.</p>
<p>These software allow people to quickly install a server environment on a non-Linux server and it often prevents problems.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for security reasons, these kind of software is only recommended for a development/private server and not a production server. Please refer to the website of the software for more information.</p>
