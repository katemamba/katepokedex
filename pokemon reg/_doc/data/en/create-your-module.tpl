<h2>Create your own module!</h2>

<p>Your module (the folder module) may not have the following name: "<em>asset</em>" and it must be written in alphanumeric character, dash or underscore and without capital.<br />
The "hello-world" module (directory: ~/YOUR-PROTECTED-FOLDER/app/modules/hello-world/) is an example module for novice developers with pH7CMS.</p>
