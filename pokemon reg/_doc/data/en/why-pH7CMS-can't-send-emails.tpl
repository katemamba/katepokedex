<h2>Why pH7CMS can't send emails?</h2>

<p>Sometime on production hosts and almost always on local hosts, you may encounter the following error message when pH7CMS has to send emails:</p>
<pre><em>Oops! We are sorry but our email server encountered an internal error and the email could not be sent. Please try again later!</em></pre>
<p>This means that there is a bad configuration for sending emails. Often these are emails that are misconfigured or an internal error with your host settings.</p>
<p>In general, we recommend checking your email configuration and if you still get the error, you should contact your hosting company to resolve the error with sending emails.</p>
<p>Also be aware that some hosting companies are blocking sending email for spam reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, we always recommend using <a href="http://ph7cms.com/doc/en/hosting" title="List of recommended Web Hosting for pH7CMS">a host recommended by us</a>.</p>
